# Experimental Record with GPGME

System for providing for a cryptographically enforced one-way information flow.

- Encrypted records
- Data retention policy - delete after date

## Dependencies
- gnupg
  - sudo apt-get install gpg
  - brew install gpg
- gpgme
  - sudo apt-get install libgpgme11-dev
  - brew install gpgme

## Cryptosystem in place
This system does not invent its own crypto, but uses GnuPG, that implements the
OpenPGP standard.

### Encrypted Message Superclass
The base of the system is `EncryptedMessage`. It needs to be subclassed.

### Filter Attributes

## Weaknesses

### Know plaintext attack
If GnuPG were to be found to be susceptible to a known plaintext attack then an attacker could learn information about the key used because encrypted records have labels or JSON keys in common. **It is not known to be susceptible to this attack with the current modern ciphers.**

This should only be possible for weak ciphers, even the classic DES is not prone to a KPA.

### Key management
Even the strongest cryptosystem will fall if end-point security fails in a way that leads to the disclosure of the secret keys that gain access to data.

- PostgreSQL has GPG support by default too.
